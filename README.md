ChemPotPy is a library for analytic representation of single-state 
and multi-state potential energy surfaces and couplings. 

All fortran source code are stored in folder chempotpy 


How to install
--------------

* Install stable release:
  
        pip install chempotpy

* The users can re-compile all .so modules for compatability reasons:

  get into the parent directory of chempotpy 
   
        ./install.script  


Citation
--------

The following paper should be cited in publications utilizing the
ChemPotPy library in addition to the original paper that publishes 
the potential energy surface subroutine:
